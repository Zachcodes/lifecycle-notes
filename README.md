## Lesson

1. Start off by talking about the component lifecycle. Use this graphic
   http://projects.wojtekmaj.pl/react-lifecycle-methods-diagram/

- 4 categories of lifecycle methods are mounting, updating, unmounting and error handling

- 5 most common lifecycle methods are constructor, render, componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate and componentWillUnmount

- render is called everytime state or props updates

2. Then walk through the code showing off the counter and the console logs for componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate and componentWillUnmount
